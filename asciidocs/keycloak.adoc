== What is it?
- a query language for requesting specific data
- client driven (the client determines which data shall be sent)
- provides descriptions of the data (self-documenting)
- doesn't send the entire object, only the requested data
- allows multiple resources to be requested at once (using object-references)
- is very performant
- has types
- allows api updates that don't break existing queries

== Similar Technologies
- REST
- gRPC

GraphQL is more performant than REST. It also simplifies the process of fetching referenced data
(data can usually be fetched in one request compared to multiple ones that are sometimes needed in REST)
It therefore fixes the problems of over- and under-fetching in rest.
(Sometimes the received data is not sufficient, sometimes it includes too much as well as unnecessary data)

== Implementation

- add jax-rs and openID-Connect
[source]
----
quarkus ext add io.quarkus:quarkus-resteasy
----
[source]
----
quarkus ext add io.quarkus:quarkus-oidc
----

- add docker-compose-keycloak.yml

.docker-compose-keycloak.yml
[source,dockerfile]
----
version: '3.9'
services:
  keycloak:
    container_name: keycloak
    environment:
      - KEYCLOAK_USER=admin
      - KEYCLOAK_PASSWORD=passme
      - DB_VENDOR=h2
    ports:
      - '8180:8080'
    image: 'quay.io/keycloak/keycloak:15.0.2'
    networks:
      - keycloak_network

networks:
  keycloak_network:
    name: keycloak_network
    driver: bridge
----

- add keycloak-up.sh and keycloak-down.sh

.keycloak-up.sh
[source,shell script]
----
docker-compose -f docker-compose-keycloak.yml up -d
----

.keycloak-down.sh
[source,shell script]
----
docker-compose -f docker-compose-keycloak.yml down
----

Start keycloak using ``./keycloak-up.sh`` (don't forget to add execution permissions (chmod +x "filename"))

connect to localhost:8180 and login with admin credentials:
username: admin
password: passme

add client with id ``my-quarkus-service``

change access type to confidential

add new roles 'user' and 'admin'
add new user 'admin' with password 'passme'

== Testing
For testing graphql endpoints, the graphql UI can be used.
It is accessible at: http://localhost:8080/q/graphql-ui/

image::graphql-ui-suggestions.png[]
GraphQL UI automatically suggests queries, mutations as well as fields
that can be selected or changed and their types.
(Use Ctrl + Space to view suggestions)

[source,graphql]
----
query listBookings{ #<1>
  allBookings{
    id,
    arrivalDate,
    bookingDate,
    departureDate
    room{
      id
    }
  }
}

mutation addBooking{ #<2>
  addBooking(booking: {
    bookingDate: "2022-01-01",
    arrivalDate: "2022-06-08",
    departureDate: "2022-06-12"
    ,room: {
      id:1,
      maxPeople: 4
      pricePerNight:250,
      roomNumber:6
    }
  }) {
    id,
    room{
      id
    }
  }
}
----
the statements are used for

<1> selecting data from all bookings
<2> adding a new booking
